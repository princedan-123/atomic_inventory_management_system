# **User App**


## üìÅ App Structure

The `users` app is structured to manage user accounts and their authentication. The key files and their responsibilities are:

-   **`models.py`**: Defines the custom `User` model, extending Django's `AbstractUser` to include additional fields such as `middle_name`, `phone_number`, `email`, `role`, and `profile_image`.
    
-   **`serializers.py`**: Serializes the `User` model for API communication, with custom methods to handle password hashing during user creation and updates.
    
-   **`views.py`**: Contains the API view logic for user authentication (login, logout) and standard user CRUD operations.
    
-   **`urls.py`**: Maps the user-related API endpoints to their corresponding views.
    
-   **`permissions.py`**: Defines custom permission classes (`IsStockManager`, `AdminUser`, `IsAgent`) to control access to different API views based on the user's role.
    

## üë• Data Models

The app's primary model is the custom `User` model.

### The `User` Model

The `User` model is a single point of truth for all users in the system. It includes fields for:

-   **`email`**: Used as the `USERNAME_FIELD` for authentication.
    
-   **`role`**: A field with choices for `admin`, `stock manager`, and `agent`, which determines the user's permissions across the entire system.
    
-   **`phone_number`**: A unique field for contact information.
    
-   **`profile_image`**: An optional image field for the user's profile picture.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Run Migrations:** Ensure the database schema is updated to include the custom `User` model.
    
2.  **Create an Admin User:** Use `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create your first `admin` user.
    
3.  **Test the Endpoints:** Use an API client like Postman or Insomnia to test the login and user CRUD functionalities.
    
4.  **Assign Roles:** Log in as the `admin` user to create other users with different roles (`stock manager`, `agent`) to test the permission-based access control.
